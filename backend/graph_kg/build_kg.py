"""
Knowledge-graph builder for IP-SAKTI — the PS's "stage 2" (after the
citation-grounded retrieval MVP), first real slice of it.

Builds a small graph over the corpus's own statutory tags (see
ingestion/chunker.py::_compile_statutory_tag_rules) with three edge types:

  1. co_occurrence     — DATA-DERIVED. Two tags get an edge if they ever
                          appear together on the same real indexed chunk.
                          Counted directly from the database; nothing here
                          is authored or guessed.
  2. category_tags      — REUSED, not new. graph/formulation.py's
                          CATEGORY_STATUTORY_TAGS already maps each
                          formulation category to a reviewed tag set; this
                          just stores that same mapping for the graph
                          lookup to use, rather than duplicating the logic.
  3. cross_jurisdiction — THE ONE GENUINELY NEW PIECE OF CONTENT. A small,
                          explicitly authored table (CROSS_JURISDICTION_PAIRS
                          below) pairing a domestic (India) tag with an
                          international tag that covers the same real-world
                          regulatory concern (e.g. the domestic NBA
                          approval process and the Nagoya Protocol's ABS
                          Clearing-House are both about access-and-
                          benefit-sharing). This is a STRUCTURAL/
                          INFORMATIONAL claim — "these two already-indexed,
                          already-cited provisions are about the same
                          topic" — not new legal text, and not a substitute
                          for legal review. Same heuristic-first-pass
                          status as every other tag rule in this codebase
                          (see chunker.py's own docstring) — a domain
                          expert should review this table before it's
                          treated as authoritative cross-referencing.

Every tag this module knows about is resolved to one real example chunk
(chunk_id/source_file/page_number/section_heading/jurisdiction) from the
live index, so a "related provision" is always a pointer to something
actually retrievable and citable — never a bare tag name floating free of
its source. Fails loudly (not silently) if a tag named in
CROSS_JURISDICTION_PAIRS doesn't actually exist in the live index — same
philosophy as ingestion/indexer.py's chunk-metadata validation: a
misconfigured cross-reference is a real bug to catch here, not something
to paper over.
