"""
Knowledge-graph lookup for IP-SAKTI — read side of graph_kg/build_kg.py.

Pure in-memory lookup against the JSON file build_kg.py writes; no I/O
beyond loading that file once. Used by graph/nodes.py::expand_related_provisions
as a deterministic, no-LLM enrichment step — same "no I/O, no LLM call"
category as graph/formulation.py's triage, for the same reason: this
project's retry mechanism exists because LLM-driven decisions aren't
perfectly reproducible run to run, so anything that doesn't need an LLM
call stays deterministic instead.

related_provisions_for() never raises: a missing or stale KG file, or a
tag no longer in it, degrades to an empty result (no related provisions
surfaced) rather than breaking the request — consistent with this
project's fail-open philosophy for every non-essential enrichment layer
(api/translation.py, api/tts.py). Losing "related provisions" is a
degraded response, not a broken one; the grounded answer and its citations
never depend on this module.

Usage:
    python -m graph_kg.kg Patents_Act_Sec3p
