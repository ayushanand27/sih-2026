"""
Sarvam AI (Bulbul) text-to-speech for IP-SAKTI.

Replaces an earlier Groq-based implementation that used
`canopylabs/orpheus-v1-english` — abandoned because (a) it required an org
admin to manually accept the model's usage terms in the Groq console before
any request would succeed at all, a step this project's Groq account never
completed, and (b) even once working it was English-only, so a Hindi (or
any other non-English) answer could never actually be *heard* in the
language it was translated into.

Sarvam's Bulbul model needs no such manual approval — SARVAM_API_KEY (see
api/translation.py, already required and already configured for this
project) is sufficient — and it natively supports voice synthesis in 11 of
the languages api/translation.py already translates into (see
BULBUL_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES below), so the answer can actually be spoken in
the user's selected language instead of always falling back to English.
Languages Sarvam translates but Bulbul cannot voice (e.g. Sanskrit,
Manipuri) fall back to skipping audio, not to a mispronounced or
wrong-language voice — same fail-open philosophy as api/translation.py.

Confirmed against Sarvam's own docs (docs.sarvam.ai/api-reference-docs/
text-to-speech/api/rest-api and .../models/bulbul, 2026-09): endpoint,
auth header, request/response shape, the 36 valid speaker names, and the
2500-character-per-request limit for bulbul:v3. Not verified against a
live call in this environment (SARVAM_API_KEY here is a real project key,
but no request was fired during this edit) — if a genuinely wrong field
name slipped through despite matching the docs, this fails open (returns
None, logs a warning) exactly like every other failure mode below, so a
demo never breaks on it; only real TTS silently doesn't play.

Usage:
    python -m api.tts "Section 3(p) excludes traditional knowledge from patentability." en-IN
    python -m api.tts "पारंपरिक ज्ञान" hi-IN
