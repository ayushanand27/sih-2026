"""
FastAPI layer for IP-SAKTI.

A thin HTTP wrapper over the LangGraph pipeline. /query runs the compiled
graph with .ainvoke() (async all the way down: Groq calls and pgvector
queries use native async clients, not blocking calls parked in a thread
pool) under a wall-clock timeout. /query/stream is the same pipeline,
answer tokens delivered as Server-Sent Events as they arrive from the LLM
instead of waiting for the full answer.

/query only (not /query/stream — translating a live token stream is a
separate, harder problem: sentence-boundary detection against a partial
buffer, not covered here) additionally wraps the graph in a translation
bridge (api/translation.py, Sarvam AI): the question translates to English
before retrieval, the answer translates back to QueryRequest.language after
generation — retrieval and the LLM prompt never see anything but English.
Optionally also returns a spoken reading of the *translated* answer via
Sarvam's Bulbul TTS (api/tts.py, QueryRequest.synthesize_audio), in
`language` itself when Bulbul supports it (11 of the languages
api/translation.py can translate into — see
api/tts.py::BULBUL_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES) or skipped otherwise, never a
mismatched English voice over translated text.

Cancellation: because the graph is now driven by real async I/O (async
psycopg, AsyncGroq/ollama.AsyncClient) instead of a thread-pool future,
asyncio.wait_for's timeout can actually cancel the in-flight call — the
connection is released immediately instead of a zombie thread continuing
to hold a DB connection or wait on an LLM response nobody is listening for
anymore. That was a real, observed problem with the previous
run_in_threadpool design (a thread-pool future can't be killed, only
abandoned) and is fixed by this change, not just faster.

Usage:
    python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload
    # or, for multiple worker processes (see Procfile):
    python -m uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 2
