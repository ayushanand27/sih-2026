"""
Sarvam AI translation bridge for IP-SAKTI.

Retrieval and generation only ever operate on English (dense/sparse
retrieval and the grounded-generation prompt are tuned against English
statutory text — see generation/prompts.py). This module is what lets a
non-English question in and a non-English answer back out around that:
translate the incoming question to English before it reaches the graph,
translate the graph's English answer back to the user's language before it
leaves the process. See idea.md: Sarvam is the interim provider (working
access now); the PS names Bhashini specifically, so this gets swapped if a
Bhashini key arrives before the demo — this module is the only place that
swap touches.

Fails open, not closed: translation is a layer over an already-correct
English pipeline, not something the demo can die on. Any failure (timeout,
bad key, Sarvam outage, unexpected response shape) logs and returns the
original text untouched rather than raising — worst case the user sees
their answer in English instead of Hindi, not a 500.

Chunks past SARVAM_MAX_CHARS: Sarvam's `mayura:v1` model hard-rejects input
over exactly 1000 characters ("Input text must not exceed 1000 characters
for mayura:v1") — confirmed empirically against the live API, not from
docs. A real grounded answer (several sentences, sometimes a bulleted list
of Act sections) routinely exceeds that; translating one straight through
without chunking meant every realistically-sized answer 400'd and silently
fell back to English every time — reproduced directly, not hypothetical.
Chunks are translated concurrently and rejoined; if any chunk fails, the
whole call falls back to the original, unchunked text rather than
returning some sentences translated and others not.

    Translate `text` from source_lang to target_lang via Sarvam AI.

    Returns the original text, unchanged, in two cases: source and target
    are the same language, or any part of the API call fails for any
    reason. The caller never needs a try/except — this function does not
    raise. See module docstring for why long text is chunked, and why a
    partial-chunk failure falls back to the *entire* original text rather
    than returning some sentences translated and others not.

    Deliberately does NOT special-case "source is English" as a shortcut —
    only source_lang == target_lang skips the API call entirely. This
    function runs in both directions (api/main.py's /query: request
    language -> en-IN before retrieval, then en-IN -> request language
    after generation), and a same-language check is the only rule that's
    correct both ways. An earlier version also skipped whenever
    source_lang.startswith("en"), which seemed like a harmless optimization
    for the first direction but silently broke the second one outright: the
    answer's source_lang is always "en-IN", so that rule would skip
    translating it to the user's language on every single request. Caught
