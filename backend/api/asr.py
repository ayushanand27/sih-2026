"""
Sarvam AI (Saaras) speech-to-text for IP-SAKTI.

Reuses SARVAM_API_KEY (see api/translation.py, api/tts.py) — no separate
key. Confirmed against Sarvam's own docs (docs.sarvam.ai/api-reference-docs/
speech-to-text/transcribe and .../models/saaras, 2026-09): endpoint, auth
header, multipart field names, and response shape. Not verified against a
live call in this environment at write time — if a field name is wrong
despite matching the docs, transcribe_audio() raises RuntimeError with the
real HTTP status/body, so the failure is loud and specific rather than a
silently wrong transcript (unlike api/translation.py and api/tts.py, ASR
has no "fall back to the original text" option — there is no text yet — so
this module does NOT fail open; see transcribe_audio()'s docstring).

Usage:
    python -m api.asr path/to/audio.wav
    python -m api.asr path/to/audio.wav hi-IN

    there is no text to fall back to — so any failure (bad key, unreachable
