Form & Registry Navigator for IP-SAKTI.

A deterministic (no LLM call, same reasoning as graph/formulation.py's
triage and graph_kg/kg.py's lookups) catalog + keyword matcher that points
a question at the actual official government form it needs next — the
PS's "facilitates access to authoritative sources... move from a question
to the right registry, record or form."

IMPORTANT CORRECTION vs. the original feature request: the NBA form
numbers requested there do not match the real Biological Diversity Rules,
2024 — verified directly against data/BD_Rules_2024.pdf, already indexed
in this project (Rules 13, 15, 16), not from general web knowledge:

  - Real Form 1 = access for RESEARCH / bio-survey / bio-utilisation (Rule
    13(1)) — the request described this content but labeled it "Form 1"
    for COMMERCIAL utilisation, which is actually real Form 2.
  - Real Form 2 = access for COMMERCIAL utilisation (Rule 13(1)).
  - Real Form 3 = prior approval to TRANSFER research results to a third
    party (Rule 15(1)(a)) — the request called this "Form 2".
  - Real Form 4 = transferee's registration to use results for FURTHER
    RESEARCH (Rule 15(1)(b)).
  - Applying for IPR/patents based on Indian biological resources
    (Section 6 of the Act) is real Form 7 (Rule 16(1)(a)), not "Form 3" —
    this is the one that matters most for a patent question, so getting
    the number right here specifically is not a minor detail.
  - Real Form 8 = registration before IPR for Section 7 persons (the
    SBB-exemption / codified-TK community route already tagged
    BDA_Sec7_SBB_Exemption elsewhere in this project) — a materially
    different, additional form worth including, not a renumbering of
    anything in the original request.

Similarly for the IPO side: the request's single "Form 8: early
publication or expedited examination" conflates two distinct real forms —
verified against Sarvam... no, against public IPO practice guides and this
project's own indexed Patent_Office_Manual_Practice_Procedure_2011.pdf
(which cites "Form-9... Rule 24A" for early publication directly):
  - Real Form 9 = request for early publication (Section 11A(2), Rule 24A).
  - Real Form 18A = request for EXPEDITED examination (Rule 24C) — a
    separate form from the plain Form 18 examination request.
  Real Form 8 is unrelated to either — it's "request or claim regarding
  mention of inventor" (Section 28, Rules 66-68).

This module ships the corrected, verified numbers. Same status as every
other heuristic catalog in this codebase (ingestion/chunker.py's tag
rules, graph_kg/build_kg.py's cross-jurisdiction table): a first pass a
domain expert / registered patent agent should review before anyone
relies on it to actually file — submission portals and deadlines in
particular change, and this is not a substitute for professional advice
(see generation/prompts.py's standing disclaimer, which /query already
appends and which this feature does not replace).

Usage:
