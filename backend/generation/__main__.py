"""
End-to-end generation demo for IP-SAKTI.

Runs the retrieval pipeline, generates a grounded answer with Groq, and
prints the answer followed by its sources — or a clear abstention with no
sources shown, if the retrieved context didn't contain the answer.

Usage:
    python -m generation "What does Section 3(p) say about traditional knowledge?"
