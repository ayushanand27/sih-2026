Indexer for IP-SAKTI.

Indexes chunks twice, because hybrid retrieval needs both:
  1. A BM25 index on disk  -> exact terms, rule numbers, section references
  2. Embeddings in pgvector -> semantic similarity

Both indexes store the same chunk_id, so results from either can be fused
and traced back to the same citation metadata.

Usage:
    python -m ingestion.indexer            # index everything in data/
    python -m ingestion.indexer --reset    # wipe and rebuild from scratch

    nothing to gain from making it async. This exists because dense_search

    resolution path on Windows, not a dead or unreachable host (a plain
    synchronous `socket.getaddrinfo()` against the same hostname at the same

    this still failed on the second attempt in testing — so this now allows
    several. Also covers Neon/Supabase's free-tier compute suspending after
    a few idle minutes and taking a moment to wake on the next connection,
    the same shape of problem. Observed symptom this fixes: the very first
    query after a lull fails with a generic 500, and a manual retry seconds
    later succeeds because the transient condition has cleared — the retry
