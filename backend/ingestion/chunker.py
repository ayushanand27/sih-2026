"""
Chunker for IP-SAKTI.

Splits page text into overlapping chunks. Every chunk carries source_file,
page_number, section_heading and chunk_id — if any of these is missing, the
citation shown to the user will be wrong or empty, so validate_chunks()
enforces it before anything reaches the indexer.

Usage:
    python -m ingestion.chunker data/AYUSH_IP_Circular.pdf

# Headings common in Indian regulatory documents: "Section 3(p)", "Rule 12",

# Pattern 1 previously had no end anchor, so `.match()` treated it as a
# prefix test: any body sentence starting with "Section 33 of the Drugs
# and Cosmetics Act..." matched, and detect_heading() returned the whole
# sentence as the "heading". The other two patterns already end in `$`
# (whole-line match); this one now does too, with a bounded optional
# title so real headings like "Rule 12: Definitions" still match while a
# sentence fragment — which continues in lowercase with no punctuation
# break — does not.
#
# Pattern 2's title cap was 60 chars, tighter than the page-level 80-char
# pre-filter below it — so a genuinely numbered heading whose title runs a
# bit long (e.g. "08.03.05.15 An invention which in effect, is traditional
# knowledge or Section 3(p)", 82 chars total) was silently skipped, and
# detect_heading() fell through to a later, unrelated heading further down
# the same page that happened to be short enough to match. Raised to 90 so
# the pattern's own cap isn't the binding constraint — the page-level
# pre-filter (also raised, see below) is.
