Chunker for IP-SAKTI.

Splits page text into overlapping chunks. Every chunk carries source_file,
page_number, section_heading and chunk_id — if any of these is missing, the
citation shown to the user will be wrong or empty, so validate_chunks()
enforces it before anything reaches the indexer.

# prefix test: any body sentence starting with "Section 33 of the Drugs
# and Cosmetics Act..." matched, and detect_heading() returned the whole
# sentence as the "heading". The other two patterns already end in `$`
# (whole-line match); this one now does too, with a bounded optional
# title so real headings like "Rule 12: Definitions" still match while a
# sentence fragment — which continues in lowercase with no punctuation
# break — does not.

# Pattern 2's title cap was 60 chars, tighter than the page-level 80-char

# bit long (e.g. "08.03.05.15 An invention which in effect, is traditional
# knowledge or Section 3(p)", 82 chars total) was silently skipped, and
# detect_heading() fell through to a later, unrelated heading further down
# the same page that happened to be short enough to match. Raised to 90 so

# pre-filter (also raised, see below) is.

    Chunks a statutory document (an Act, in this corpus) at its actual legal
    boundaries — one chunk per lettered/numbered clause within a section,
    each carrying its parent section's number and title — instead of a
    fixed character window that cuts across clause boundaries indifferent
    to what they mean.

    Why this matters concretely: "What is a trademark?" was a known,
    reproduced retrieval weak spot (see tests/test_retrieval_determinism.py)
    even after fixing BM25 tokenization — the sliding-window chunker mixed
    Trade_Marks_Act_1999's actual definition, Section 2(1)(zb), into a
    2000-character window alongside a dozen unrelated definitions ("(b)
    assignment", "(c) associated trade marks", ...), diluting it. This
    chunker gives clause (zb) its own chunk, headed "Section 2(1).
    Definitions and interpretation. Clause (zb):", so retrieval sees a
    passage that IS the definition, not one that merely contains it among
    others.

    Deliberately not a full parse-tree/AST: real nesting in these Acts goes
    section -> sub-section -> lettered clause -> sub-clause (e.g. 2(1)(zb)
    (i)), and building a fully general, verified-correct parser for every
    nesting pattern across every Indian legislative drafting convention is
    a much larger undertaking than this pass covers. What's implemented is
    the single most common and highest-value pattern — a numbered section
    containing a flat list of lettered clauses — verified against two real
    documents (Trade_Marks_Act_1999's Section 2, Patents_Act_1970's Section
    3) before being trusted, and gated by
    MIN_SECTIONS_TO_TRUST_HIERARCHICAL_PARSE so a document that doesn't
    actually have this structure falls back to the plain chunker rather
    than being silently mis-chunked by a pattern match that doesn't apply
    to it. Not run against every document in the corpus for that reason —
