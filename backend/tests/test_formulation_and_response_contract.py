"""
Unit tests for the 6th formulation category (new_or_non_classical_drug),
the mandatory disclaimer (generation/prompts.py), and confidence_score
(graph/nodes.py, graph/state.py) — the three real gaps identified against
SIH26045's problem statement text (clinical-trial pathway classification,
"clearly state that it provides information and not legal advice", and a
confidence signal in the response), as opposed to claims in the same
blueprint that turned out to already be implemented or to describe a
regression if followed literally (see graph/nodes.py, api/translation.py).

No live DATABASE_URL, LLM key, or Sarvam key required — everything here is
pure/deterministic (graph.formulation.triage_formulation,
generation.prompts.append_disclaimer), unlike test_retrieval_determinism.py
and test_translation_term_protection.py's integration tests against real
services.

Usage:
    python -m pytest tests/test_formulation_and_response_contract.py -v
