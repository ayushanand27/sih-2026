"""
Contract test for docs/API_CONTRACT.md.

Not a test of behavior — a test that the *documented* field set actually
matches the real Pydantic models backend/api/main.py serves. Exists because
this doc has gone stale before without anyone noticing until a teammate
building against it got confused: it predated /query/stream entirely and
was missing 7 request/response fields (jurisdiction, language,
synthesize_audio, formulation_category, needs_clarification,
clarifying_questions, audio_base64, flags.weak_grounding) by the time it
was rewritten. This test won't catch every kind of doc drift (wrong
example values, stale timing numbers), but it will catch the most damaging
kind: a field silently added or removed from the actual API that the doc
doesn't mention, which is exactly what happened last time.

When this test fails: a field was added/removed/renamed in QueryRequest,
QueryResponse, or Flags. Update docs/API_CONTRACT.md's field tables to
match, then update DOCUMENTED_* below to match the doc.

Usage:
    python -m pytest tests/test_api_contract.py -v
