"""
Tests for the knowledge-graph enrichment layer (graph_kg/), the first real
slice of the PS's suggested "stage 2" — see graph_kg/build_kg.py and
graph_kg/kg.py's module docstrings for the design rationale.

Requires the knowledge graph to already be built (`python -m
graph_kg.build_kg`, run once against the live corpus) for the tests that
check real content — same precondition test_retrieval_determinism.py has
on the corpus itself being indexed. The pure-logic tests (empty input,
unknown tag) don't depend on that and would still pass even against a
missing graph file, since graph_kg.kg is designed to degrade to [] rather
than raise either way.

Usage:
    python -m pytest tests/test_knowledge_graph.py -v
