Reproducibility tests for the retrieval + rerank pipeline.

Direct response to a real, reproduced flakiness finding: running the exact
same request for "What is a trademark?" three times in a row (via the live
/query endpoint) returned abstain / answer / answer — not because retrieval
was non-deterministic, but because the *first-pass* BM25/dense/rerank score
was already weak (BM25 missed Trade_Marks_Act_1999.pdf entirely — the Act's
own text says "trade marks", two words, and the query said "trademark",
one word, sharing zero BM25 tokens), which meant the bounded retry fired,
and *that* retry rephrases the query via an LLM call that isn't perfectly
reproducible run to run even at temperature 0.

The fix (ingestion/indexer.py's DOMAIN_SYNONYMS) is at the tokenization
layer, not the retry layer — the retry mechanism itself was already
correctly bounded and deterministic in its own logic (see
graph/nodes.py::should_retry). These tests verify the fix at the layer it
was actually made: BM25/dense/rerank are pure functions of the corpus and
the query text (no LLM call inside retrieve() or rerank_node() at all), so
whatever score they produce for a given query is now provably identical
run to run — which is what test_trademark_query_reranked_results_identical
_across_runs actually proves, bit-for-bit, not approximately.

What the tokenization fix did NOT fully resolve, found by actually running
this suite rather than assuming success: "What is a trademark?" still
scores below RERANK_SCORE_THRESHOLD and still triggers the retry, every
run — BM25 now correctly surfaces Trade_Marks_Act_1999 chunks (proven by
test_bm25_trademark_finds_the_act), but the specific passages that survive
fusion + rerank are registration/infringement procedure text, not the
Act's actual definitional clause, so a low cross-encoder confidence there
is an honest relevance judgment about *those specific passages*, not a
bug to mask by lowering the threshold. See
test_trademark_query_retry_decision_is_consistent for what's actually
asserted here: not "never retries" (falsified), but "retries the same way
every time" (proven) — which is still the fix that matters, since a query
that deterministically always retries is not flaky, even though it's not
free of the retry's own LLM-driven, imperfectly-reproducible rephrase step.

A second attempt, also tried and also falsified rather than assumed: a
later pass added HierarchicalStatutoryChunker (ingestion/chunker.py),
which does give Trade_Marks_Act_1999's Section 2(1)(zb) — the Act's actual
"trade mark" definition — its own clean, complete, correctly-cited chunk
(see test_section_2_1_zb_is_its_own_clean_chunk). That's a real fix for
citation precision. It did NOT fix this query's retry, and checking why
rather than assuming it would: BOTH retrievers individually rank the (zb)
chunk far outside FUSED_TOP_K=20 on their own (BM25 rank 145, dense rank
46, in Trade_Marks_Act_1999's ~474-chunk clause-level index) — a short,
term-sparse definition loses to longer provisions that repeat "trade
mark"/"mark" far more often, on both signals. Confirmed the reranker
would prefer it once it's actually a candidate, but confirmed widening
FUSED_TOP_K to 100 still doesn't include it (RRF needs ~top-500 pooling
to reach its rank-74 combined score) — and forcing every query through a
500-candidate rerank pass to rescue one query's ranking is the same
disproportionate trade the threshold change was declined for. Left as a
known, honestly-documented retrieval-ranking limitation for short
definitional clauses in a large single-document corpus, not silently
"fixed" by the chunking change alone.

Requires a live DATABASE_URL and BM25 index (`python -m ingestion.indexer`
already run) — these are integration tests against the real pipeline, not
mocks, on purpose: the bug this guards against was only visible against
real retrieval, real BM25 tokenization, and the real corpus.
