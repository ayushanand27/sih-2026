"""
Regression test for a real bug found while capturing live API output for
docs/API_CONTRACT.md, not from theory: api/translation.py's protected-term
placeholder used to be alphabetic ("XPROTECTEDTERMX{index}X"), which Sarvam
read as an unrecognized English word and transliterated into Devanagari
instead of passing through untouched. The exact-string restore in
_restore_terms() then never matched, and the mangled placeholder
("एक्सप्रोटेक्टेडटेरएमएक्स0एक्स") leaked into a real, user-facing answer —
reproduced with `python -m api.translation`, not assumed. Fixed by switching
to a purely numeric placeholder (confirmed against the live API: numbers
survive Sarvam's translation verbatim, words don't). This test is what
would catch the placeholder format regressing back to something
word-shaped.

Requires SARVAM_API_KEY — this is an integration test against the real
Sarvam API, not a mock, on purpose: the bug this guards against was only
visible against real translation behavior, which a mock can't reproduce.

Usage:
    python -m pytest tests/test_translation_term_protection.py -v
