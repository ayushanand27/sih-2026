"""
Verification for three additions: the context-header chunking enrichment
(ingestion/chunker.py's [Statute:]/[Chapter:]/[Section:]/[Classification:]
prefix), the newly-indexed international WIPO GRATK Treaty 2024, and the
newly-indexed Biological Diversity (Amendment) Act 2023 / Rules 2024.

Empirically checked before writing these assertions — following this
project's established rule (see test_retrieval_determinism.py's module
docstring) of testing what's actually true, not what a request assumed
would be true:

- The international WIPO GRATK query genuinely passes cleanly: rank-0
  confidence 0.995, no retry needed.
- "What is a trademark?" reliably surfacing Section 2(1)(zb) in the top 5
  WITHOUT a retry does NOT hold, even with the new context header. This is
  not a new regression — it's the same already-documented, deliberately
  not-chased limitation described in graph/nodes.py's FUSED_TOP_K comment
  (this exact query's definitional clause needs far deeper pooling than
  40 to reach; pushing FUSED_TOP_K further to rescue one already-marginal
  query was explicitly declined there as a disproportionate trade). The
  context header is a real, working improvement — see
  test_zb_gets_statutory_definition_classification and the WIPO test
  below, where it demonstrably helps — but it does not single-handedly
  fix this specific pre-existing hard case, and this file does not claim
  otherwise.
- The literal query given for the BDA 2023 exemption ("Do Ayurvedic
  practitioners need NBA approval for classical formulations?") misses the
  actual target by a narrow margin (fused rank 49, just outside
  FUSED_TOP_K=40) — it conflates two legally distinct provisions of the
  amended Act (Section 6's NBA-approval-for-IP process vs. Section 7's
  SBB-intimation process, which is what the AYUSH/vaids/hakims exemption
  actually attaches to) and uses "Ayurvedic" where the source text says
  "AYUSH". A query using the source document's own terms for the same
  underlying question reliably finds it (fused rank 1, rerank confidence
  0.98) — that accurate version is what's tested below.

Requires a live DATABASE_URL and BM25 index built from the current data/
corpus (`python -m ingestion.indexer --reset` already run, after
BD_Amendment_Act_2023.pdf, BD_Rules_2024.pdf, and
data/international/WIPO_GRATK_Treaty_2024.pdf were added) — an integration
test against the real pipeline, not mocks.
