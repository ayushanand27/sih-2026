"""
BM25 sparse retrieval for IP-SAKTI.

Loads the per-jurisdiction BM25 indexes built by ingestion.indexer and
searches with the identical tokenizer used at index time — imported, not
redefined, because if the two ever diverge, BM25 silently stops matching
with no error to tell you.

One BM25Okapi per jurisdiction, not one shared index post-filtered
afterward: jurisdiction is applied *during* the BM25 pass itself, the same
way dense_search's SQL WHERE clause applies it during the dense pass — see
ingestion/indexer.py::build_bm25 for why.

Usage:
    python -m retrieval.bm25_search "Section 3(p) traditional knowledge"
