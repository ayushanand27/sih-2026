"""
Cross-encoder reranking for IP-SAKTI.

BM25 and dense retrieval each rank chunks by comparing separate embeddings
or token overlap; a cross-encoder reads the query and a chunk together in one
forward pass, which is more accurate for real relevance. This is the last
filter before chunks reach the LLM, so it decides what the model is even
allowed to answer from.

Score calibration: ms-marco-MiniLM outputs raw, unbounded logits (observed
range roughly -11 to +7 on this corpus — see the empirical spread below),
not a probability. rerank_score is now sigmoid(raw_logit), a 0-1 confidence
score comparable across queries, which raw logits are not (a "-3.5" means
something different depending on how spread out that particular query's
candidate scores happen to be). Empirical spread, five real queries against
the live corpus, top-3 each: on-topic queries the corpus genuinely covers
(traditional knowledge / Section 3(p), geographical indications) scored
sigmoid 0.92-0.999; queries with no real answer in this corpus (capital of
France, baking a cake) scored sigmoid ~0.000. RERANK_SCORE_THRESHOLD = 0.15
sits well above the "clearly nothing here" cluster and well below the
"clearly answered" cluster — calibrated against that small, real spread,
not against a rigorous labeled precision/recall study across the full
corpus, which this doesn't claim to be.

Usage:
    python -m retrieval.reranker "Section 3(p) traditional knowledge"
