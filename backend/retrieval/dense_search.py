"""
Dense (embedding) retrieval for IP-SAKTI.

Embeds the query with the same model used at ingestion time (EMBED_MODEL)
and finds the closest chunks in pgvector by cosine similarity. Embeddings are
normalized at both index and query time, so `1 - cosine_distance` is directly
comparable to the BM25 scores' ranking (not their scale — RRF only uses rank).

Usage:
    python -m retrieval.dense_search "what protects Ayurvedic formulations"
