"""
Reciprocal Rank Fusion for IP-SAKTI.

Merges the BM25 and dense ranked lists into one, so a chunk that ranks well
in either (or both) rises to the top. Legal text needs both exact-term
matching and semantic matching, so neither list is trusted alone.

score(chunk) = sum of 1 / (k + rank) across every list the chunk appears in,
with k = 60 and rank 1-indexed within each list.

Usage:
    python -m retrieval.fusion "Section 3(p) traditional knowledge"
