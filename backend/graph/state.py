Graph state for IP-SAKTI.

A single TypedDict threaded through every node. LangGraph merges each node's
returned dict into this state, so a node only needs to return the keys it
actually changes.

# Callers must seed state with this, not {} — nodes only ever set flags they

# path), so starting from {} means "retried" is simply absent from the
# response on the common no-retry path instead of present-and-False. That
# makes the API response shape inconsistent for callers checking flags["retried"].
#
# weak_grounding is set unconditionally by rerank_node on every path (unlike
# retried), but included here anyway so the key is never simply absent for a
# caller reading flags before rerank_node has run.
